The solution to this problem depends entirely on the specific library and the error messages you see.  However, a common troubleshooting strategy includes:

1. **Check Library Documentation:** The most important step. Consult the third-party library's documentation for setup instructions, known issues, and compatibility requirements.
2. **Verify Dependencies:** Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to inspect the dependency tree and ensure all required packages are correctly installed and that there are no version conflicts.
3. **Clean and Reinstall:** Try cleaning your project's cache and reinstalling all node modules (`npm cache clean --force && npm install` or `yarn cache clean && yarn install`).
4. **Update Libraries:** Update both your React Native version and the third-party library to their latest versions.
5. **Check Package.json:** Verify that the versions of your third-party library and its dependencies are compatible with your React Native version.  Sometimes, specifying exact versions can resolve unexpected behavior.
6. **Search for Related Issues:** Search online forums and issue trackers (like GitHub) for similar problems encountered by other users of the same library.  There's a good chance someone has already encountered and resolved the same problem.

Example (Illustrative):

```javascript
// Incorrect (Assume 'someLibrary' has unmet peerDependency)
import someLibrary from 'some-library';

// Solution (Ensure peer dependencies are met)
// Add peer dependency of 'some-library' to package.json and reinstall
```
